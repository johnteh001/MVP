Some things to think about
End-to-end
Prioritize getting all the pieces put together and proving the entire user experience. If you are doing a web project, lets say a food delivery app, it will be important that an order can be placed, received by a delivery-person, and marked as delivered. Refer back to the user stories and ensure each of those workflows is functional.

If you’re done early
Keep going! Add more features, tests, and polish the features you’ve completed. If you don’t have ideas for how to enhance your project, then ask your peers.

Manual QA Review
It is your responsibility to request a review for your Google Doc from a peer before the project’s deadline. If no peers have been reviewed, you should request a review from a staff member.
